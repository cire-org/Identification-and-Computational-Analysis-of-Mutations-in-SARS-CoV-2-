It is a python raw code which computes the 2D polar plot co-ordinates and the qR characterization value of an amino acid 
sequence. Input is given as a amino acid sequence only and it prints a python list. The items of the list are as follows.

[cox,coy,qrx,qry,n,z,qr]

where, cox = list of x coordinates
coy = list of y coordinates		(cox and coy are of same length)
qrx = sumx value
qry = sumy value
n = total recognizable amino acids present
z = total unknown amino acids
qr = the qR value
